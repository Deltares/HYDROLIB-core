Both will then spin up a new container in which we can work.

Visual Studio Code might prompt you to select an interpreter. If it does press the 'Select Python Interpreter', and select the virtual environment residing in <code>./.venv/</code>.

The <code>TimModel</code> makes use of the <code>TimParser</code> class and <code>TimSerializer</code> class. While the <code>TimModel</code> class should be publicly exposed to the users, because it is part of the public API, the parser and serializer classes are implementation details that users should not be concerned with. The parser and serializer should therefore not be publicly exposed to the users. </p> <p>To expose the <code>TimModel</code> explicitly to our users, you have to update both the <code>hydrolib/core/dflowfm/tim/__init__.py</code> (assuming you created a new <code>tim</code> folder for this new functionality) and the <code>hydrolib/core/dflowfm/__init__.py</code>:</p> <pre><code># hydrolib/core/dflowfm/tim/__init__.py\nfrom .models import TimModel\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"TimModel\",\n]\n</code></pre> <pre><code># hydrolib/core/dflowfm/__init__.py\n...\n...\nfrom .tim import *\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/developers/#updating-the-documentation","title":"Updating the documentation","text":"<p>In the hydrolib-core repository there are several reference files that are used to automatically generate the API reference.

Since this is new functionality that affects the API, we have to update the reference files. The API reference files are located at <code>docs\\reference</code>. Since the <code>TimModel</code> was newly introduced, we should create a new file named <code>tim.md</code>. The contents of this file include a short description about what the '.tim' file is and what it is used for, followed by the actual API. You do not have to manually write the API, that is done for us by mkdocs.

These files generally form a sort of tree structure, with a single root model (generally a DIMR or an FM model), and different layers of child models  which are referenced in their parent models. These child models can either be  referenced relative to their parent models or with absolute file paths. This leads to potentially complex model structures, which need to be read and written correctly  by HYDROLIB-core without any changes to either the contents or the structure.</p> <p>This article discusses the architectural choices made when designing the read and write  capabalities, as well as the considerations that should be taken when implementing your own models.

Properties should not be adjusted nor dropped when reading or writing (unless there is a very  clear reason to do so). This behaviour should extend to the way the tree structure  of the models is handled. Therefor, file paths, stored in the <code>filepath</code> property, which are not explicitly set to be absolute are kept relative and resolved while reading or writing. </p> <p>This has the drawback that the file location of a child model is not explicitly defined without the root model it is part of. Within the current implementation, child models have no reference to their parent. This simplifies the bookkeeping when building models in memory, however it also means that it is not possible  to resolve the absolute path of a child model without also providing the root model it is part of. This behaviour is further documented in the following sections. In order to alleviate this shortcoming, each file model internally keeps track of its  resolved save location, which can be explicitly synchronized with the file path of the root model, if this is required.</p>"},{"location":"topics/loadsave/#loading-models-resolving-the-tree-structure-with-the-fileloadcontext","title":"Loading Models: Resolving the tree structure with the <code>FileLoadContext</code>","text":"<p>In order to load a model from disk, we need to call the appropriate constructor with a file path to an existing model file.
