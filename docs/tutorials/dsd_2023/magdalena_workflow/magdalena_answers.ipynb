    "# Creating a Delft3D FM 1D2D fluvial flood model of Magdalena river \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises in this notebook will serve as introduction on how to use [HYDROLIB-core](https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB-core) functionalities. We will create and adjust a Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D fluvial flood model of the Magdalena river in Columbia. \n",

    "First a 1D river model of the Magdalena river and Canal del Dique will be created, shown in the left figure. This model will be extended with a 2D Flexible Mesh, with a uniform roughness field. Adding a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) on that 2D mesh is currently not part of this tutorial, but in practice this is indispensible to mimic the fluvial flood patterns.\n",

    "HYDROLIB-core is a Python package that offers functionality to process D-HYDRO input files. It offers Python-wrapped classes that represent these files and their content. \n",
    "HYDROLIB-core serves as the basis for various pre- and postprocessing tools for a modelling workflow of hydrodynamic simulations in D-HYDRO. It can easily be used to build models and export the model files that can aftewards be run by dflowfm or other supported D-HYDRO kernels.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize modelers with applying HYDROLIB-core functionalities in their modelling procedures for building new models or adjusting existing models. As mentioned above, you will create an 1D2D fluvial flood model from scratch using the D-Flow FM HYDROLIB-core functionalities and the underlying functions from mesh generation ([MeshKernelPy](https://github.com/Deltares/MeshKernelPy)). We will walk through the following steps to build the model:\n",
