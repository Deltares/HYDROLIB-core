# Introduction to tutorials

Several (iPython notebook) tutorials have been prepared for HYDROLIB-core:

* Tutorial: [Build a basic model](build_basic_model.ipynb) - iPython notebook
* Tutorial: [Loading and saving a model](loading_and_saving_a_model.md) 
* Tutorial: [Dataframe handling](dataframe_handling.md)
* Tutorial: [Plotting a network](plotting_a_network.md)

To run these examples on your local machine you need a copy of the repository and an installation of HYDROLIB-core including some additional packages. The installation of HYDROLIB-core is explained in [Installation](../guides/setup.md).
