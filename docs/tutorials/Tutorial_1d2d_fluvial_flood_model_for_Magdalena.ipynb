    "# Tutorial Delft3D FM 1D2D fluvial flood model of Magdalena river \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an introduction on how to use [HYDROLIB-core](https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB-core) functionalities to create and adjust a Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D fluvial flood model of the Magdalena river in Columbia. First a 1D river model of the Magdalena river and Canal del Dique will be created, shown in the left figure. This model will be extended with a 2D Flexible Mesh, with a uniform roughness field. Adding a DTM on that 2D mesh is currently not part of this tutorial, but normally this is of course indispensible to mimic the fluvial flood patterns. Running the model or importing the model in the Delft3D FM Suite 1D2D is not shown in this tutorial.  \n",

    " ```HYDROLIB-core``` is the core library of Python wrappers around the D-HYDRO Suite 1D2D model files (input and output) and model engines (kernel libraries). ```HYDROLIB``` is a Python package with tools for pre-processing, post-processing and analysis of hydrodynamical data and simulation results, currently focused on Delft3D Suite 1D2D. [HYDROLIB](https://github.com/Deltares/HYDROLIB) builds upon the basic HYDROLIB-core functionalities.\n",

    "The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize modelers with how to apply HYDROLIB-core functionalities in their modelling procedures for building new models or adjusting existing models. As mentioned above, you will create an 1D2D fluvial flood model from scratch using the ```D-Flow FM``` HYDROLIB-core functionalities and the underlying functions from mesh generation ([MeshKernelPy](https://github.com/Deltares/MeshKernelPy)). The building of the model is done by the following steps\n",
