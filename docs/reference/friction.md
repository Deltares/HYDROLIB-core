## 1D roughness .ini files
The friction module provides the specific logic for accessing friction/1D roughness files
for a [D-Flow FM](glossary.md#d-flow-fm) model.

Generic parsing and serializing functionality comes from the generic hydrolib.core.io.ini modules.

A 1D roughness file is described by the classes below.
