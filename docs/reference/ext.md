# External forcings file
The external forcing .ext file contains the forcing data for a [D-Flow FM](glossary.md#d-flow-fm) model.
This includes open boundaries, lateral discharges and meteorological forcings.
The documentation below only concerns the 'new' format (`ExtForceFileNew` in the MDU file).
