# Glossary
The list below is a nonexhaustive list of terminology and concepts used in HYDROLIB(-core) and Delft3D Flexible Mesh.

## A
---

## B
---
### BC file
Input file containing the actual forcing data for model forcings specified elsewhere in the model input, for example time series or astronomical components.
Originates from boundary conditions as specified in the [external forcings file](#external-forcings-file), but nowadays also used in [structure files](#structure-file). More details about the syntax and the various supported function types in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#subsection.E.2.3).

### Boundary condition
Flow (or constituent) boundary condition that forces a [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) model, such as waterlevel and discharge boundary conditions. Defined in the [external forcings file](#external-forcings-file). More details in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#subsubsection.C.5.2.1).

### Branch
The network edges in a network topology of 1D models. The computational [grid](#grid) points are positioned on these branches using branch id and a [chainage](#chainage) value.

### Branch Id
Identification text string for a particular [branch](#branch) in a 1D network.

## C
---
### Chainage
The distance along a 1D network [branch](#branch) to define a specific location on that branch. Always used in combination with a [branch Id](#branch-id).

### CF conventions
Established metadata conventions for storing all kinds of data, e.g., model input and output, in NetCDF files. More details on: https://cfconventions.org/.
HYDROLIB-core and Delft3D Flexible Mesh rely on CF, and extend this with [UGRID conventions](#ugrid-conventions) where unstructured grids are applicable.

### Computational backend
Computational core, also called kernel. The program/library of simulation software that does the actual calculations. Often also available with a graphical user interface on top of it.

### Cross section files
Input files for [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) that define the 1D network's cross sections.
Two parts: [cross section definition file](#cross-section-definition-file) and [cross section location files](#cross-section-location-file). Not to be confused with [observation cross section files](#observation-cross-section-file)!

### Cross section definition file
Input file for [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) that defines the various cross section shapes in a model with a 1D network. Format is INI-like. More details in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#subsection.C.16.1).

### Cross section location file
Input file for [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) that defines the location of cross section shapes in a model with a 1D network. Each location refers to a (possible shared) [cross section definition](#cross-section-definition-file). Format is INI-like. More details in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#subsection.C.16.2).

## D
---
### Deltares conventions
A proposal for additional NetCDF conventions that build on the existing [UGRID conventions](#ugrid-conventions), intended to properly describe 1D network topologies as a coordinate space on which 1D computational grids are defined. Also 1D2D grid couplings are included.
More details in: the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#section.B.2).

### D-Flow FM
D-Flow Flexible Mesh. The computational backend that solves 1D/2D/3D hydrodynamics in the Delf3D Flexible Mesh Suite.
Toplevel input is the [MDU file](#mdu-file). More details in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf).

More details on: https://www.deltares.nl/nl/d-hydro-suite-1d2d-beta/.

### DIMR
Deltares Integrated Model Runner. Executable/library that runs [integrated models](#integrated-model) by coupling multiple [computational backends](#computational-backend) in a simulation timeloop. Uses a single [DIMR config file](#dimr-config-file) as input.

### DIMR config file
Input file for [DIMR](#dimr) (typically ``dimr_config.xml``) for an [integrated model](#integrated-model) run, describing which models are coupled and which quantities need to be exchanged.

## E

### External forcings file
Input file for [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) describing model forcings such as [boundary conditions](#boundary-condition), [laterals](#lateral) and [meteo](#meteo). Format is INI-like. More details in the [Delft3D FM User Manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Flow_FM_User_Manual.pdf#subsection.C.5.2).

## F
---
### Face (mesh)
A geometrical "cell" in a 2D mesh. Formed by 3 or more [mesh nodes](#node-mesh) as its vertices. Building block of the [UGRID-conventions](#ugrid-conventions).

### Flow link
An open connection/interface between two [flow nodes](#flow-node) in the [staggered](#staggered-grid) [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) model grid. Is the same as a "velocity point", and corresponds with (but is not equal to) an [edge](#edge-mesh), both in 1D and in 2D. In 3D a flow link corresponds with a 3D [face](#face-mesh) between two [volumes](#volume-mesh).

### Flow node
A single finite volume "cell" in the [staggered](#staggered-grid) [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) model grid. Is the same as a "pressure point", and is in fact a [face](#face-mesh) in 2D/3D or a [node](#node-mesh) in 1D.

## G
---
### Grid
The computational grid on which a flow simulation is done. The grid for [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) is defined in an input [net file](#net-file]), and also appears (slightly differently) in the output [map file](#map-file).

### Grid snapping
The snapping of [D-Flow FM](#d-flow-fm) model input in x,y-coordinates to discrete locations in the [staggered model grid](#staggered-grid). This process makes most model input independent of the chosen model grid and grid resolution.
Snapping is done either to (sets of) [flow nodes](#flow-node) or (sequence of) [flow links](#flow-link), depending on whether pressure-point data or velocity-point data is concerned.

## H
