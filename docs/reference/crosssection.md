# Cross section files
The crosssection module provides the specific logic for accessing cross section files (location and definition)
for a [D-Flow FM](glossary.md#d-flow-fm) model.
Generic parsing and serializing functionality comes from the generic hydrolibcore.io.dflowfm.ini modules.

The cross section files are represented by the classes below.
